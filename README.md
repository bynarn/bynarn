## Hi there 👋

I'm Bryan, located in Mexico. Former lawyer, currently learning Full Stack Web Development, shifted to this area since I was always tech sabby & curious overall about technology, building & creating.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on full stack web development projects, examples, a coffeeshop page & much more to come!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React & AWS.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any type of project I can get my hands on, to gather experience & knowledge overall.

- ⚡ Fun facts: I really like to workout, play videogames, wacch good movies/animes/series, a DJ as a side hustle. I try to be a music expert since I really do like to talk about music overall with anyone I get the chance to. I can speak 3 languages. I love me some good coffee & like to hangout with my family & friends.

- Pleasure to me you.
